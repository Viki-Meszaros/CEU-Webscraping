## Web scraping assignment 2
This folder contains all the files created for the second assignment of my web scraping class at Central European University.

## Aim
In the project I scraped all the data I found useful from the website [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/) and created 5 separate data tables.

**Folders**
* [Codes](https://github.com/Viki-Meszaros/CEU-Webscraping/tree/main/Assignment_2/Codes) - has all the files written for the assignment (Assignment_2.Rmd is a report of the project)
* [Data](https://github.com/Viki-Meszaros/CEU-Webscraping/tree/main/Assignment_2/Data) - contains the data tables I scpared
* [Out](https://github.com/Viki-Meszaros/CEU-Webscraping/tree/main/Assignment_2/Out) - has the report of the project (output of (Assignment_2.Rmd)
