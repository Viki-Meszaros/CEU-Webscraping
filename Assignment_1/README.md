# Webscraping Assignment 1

This repository contains all the files for the first assignment in Webscraping. The task was to write an R code which downloads information from a url to dataframe from the website that we found interesting. I used [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) website for this project. 

**Folders**
* [Codes](https://github.com/Viki-Meszaros/CEU-Webscraping/tree/main/Assignment_1/Codes) - contains an R script and an R markdown file with the function I used.
* [Output](https://github.com/Viki-Meszaros/CEU-Webscraping/tree/main/Assignment_1/Output) - has the html output of my markdown file as well as the saved csv file of the scraped data
